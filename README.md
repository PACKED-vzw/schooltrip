#SchoolTrip
Schooltrip is a tool that allows students to create their own school journey. Through an online interface the teacher can set a couple of parameters defining the skeleton of the trip. Students fill the template with information on practicalities, cultural heritage sites to visit, historical information, and so on. They learn to plan a travel from a to z, while incorporating our cultural heritage. At the end, a journal-like document is generated which can be used as itinerary guidebook.

Documentation may be found at the [AthenaPlus wiki](http://wiki.athenaplus.eu/index.php/SchoolTrip).
 
SchoolTrip was created by [PACKED vzw](http://packed.be/) as part of the [AthenaPlus project](http://www.athenaplus.eu/) funded by the European Commission.
